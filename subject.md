# cub3D
**My first RayCaster with miniLibX**

## Chapter V – Mandatory Part: cub3D
**Program name:** `cub3D`  
**Arguments:** A map file with `.cub` extension  
**Libft authorized:** Yes  

### Allowed External Functions
- `open`, `close`, `read`, `write`
- `printf`, `malloc`, `free`, `perror`, `strerror`, `exit`
- `gettimeofday`
- Math library (`-lm`)
- All **miniLibX** functions

### Description
Create a realistic 3D graphical representation of a maze from a first-person point of view using ray-casting.

### Contraints
- You must use the miniLibX. Either the version that is available on the operating
system, or from its sources. If you choose to work with the sources, you will
need to apply the same rules for your libft as those written above in Common
Instructions part.

- The management of your window must remain smooth: changing to another win-
dow, minimizing, etc.

- Display different wall textures (the choice is yours) that vary depending on which
side the wall is facing (North, South, East, West).

- Your program must be able to set the floor and ceiling colors to two different ones.

- The program displays the image in a window and respects the following rules:
    > The left and right arrow keys of the keyboard must allow you to look left and
right in the maze
    > The W, A, S, and D keys must allow you to move the point of view through
the maze.
    > Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly
    > Clicking on the red cross on the window’s frame must close the window and
quit the program cleanly.
    > The use of images of the minilibX library is strongly recommended.

- Your program must take as a first argument a scene description file with the .cub
extension
    > The map must be composed of only 6 possible characters: 0 for an empty space,
1 for a wall, and N,S,E or W for the player’s start position and spawning
orientation.
    > The map must be closed/surrounded by walls, if not the program must return
an error.
    > Except for the map content, each type of element can be separated by one or
more empty lines
    > Except for the map content which always has to be the last, each type of
element can be set in any order in the file.
    > Except for the map, each type of information from an element can be separated
by one or more spaces.
    > The map must be parsed as it looks in the file. Spaces are a valid part of the
map and are up to you to handle. You must be able to parse any kind of map,
as long as it respects the rules of the map
    > Except for the map, each element must begin with its type identifier (composed
by one or two characters), followed by its specific information in a strict order:
    >> NO texture
    >> SO texture
    >> WE texture
    >> EA texture
    >> F, floor color
    >> C, ceiling color
