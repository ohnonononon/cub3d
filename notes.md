Creating a rayCaster with MLX

## Notes

### CODAM
CODAM MLX is allowed, must be downloaded and compiled with to work. It's documented, it's not that much of stuff.

### development roadmap

- Creating the window system, set interactions with hook such as close, etc. Subject says:
``` Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
    Clicking on the red cross on the window’s frame must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
```
- Rendering a 2d representation of the map. This is part of bonus but allows to program the basic interaction such as moving and changing focus direction. Map to be interacted with can be hardset in an array.

- Handle parsing: decide on map possibilities, set limits.
- Integration of map for rendering of 2d
- Recreate 3D representation based of 2d
